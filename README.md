# A module for mapping ATVs with some binaries and useful functions.
# Only works with Cosmog atm.

Based on the original eMagisk, but without all the bloat that slowed down the shell on ATVs.


## If release CI not working
```console
git clone

zip -r emagic.zip . -x ".git/*" "build.sh" ".gitignore" "*zip"
```
